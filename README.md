# VOXD

VOXD is a small Linux tray app for speech typing. It records until you stop,
transcribes through a local OpenAI-compatible Gemma E4B service, and inserts the
result as genuine keyboard input with `ydotool`.

It deliberately has one runtime path: tray → recorder → E4B → clipboard recovery
copy → `ydotool`. There is no Whisper model manager, post-processing layer,
paste-based insertion, or continuous VAD mode.

## What it supports

- Hindi in Latin/Roman script (Hinglish), English, and mixed speech
- punctuation inferred from pauses and intonation
- recordings of arbitrary practical length
- E4B's sub-30-second input limit through sequential 25-second segments with a
  1-second overlap
- complete text insertion into terminals and coding tools through real key events
- failure recovery: source audio is kept if transcription fails, and VOXD tries
  to copy the final transcript before typing

Recording is streamed to bounded on-disk chunks, so speech duration is not capped
by memory. Transcription begins after Stop and processes each E4B segment in order.

## Requirements

- Linux with PipeWire/PulseAudio or another PortAudio input
- Python 3.9+
- `ydotool`, `ydotoold`, and a working user `ydotoold.service`
- an OpenAI-compatible E4B endpoint, defaulting to `http://localhost:9292`

The endpoint must accept audio content at `/v1/chat/completions` using the
OpenAI-style `input_audio` message shape.

## Source install

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Then start the tray:

```bash
.venv/bin/voxd --tray
```

Bind a desktop shortcut to toggle recording:

```bash
/absolute/path/to/voxd/.venv/bin/voxd --trigger-record
```

Start speaking after the tray shows Recording. Trigger again to stop; VOXD waits
for the complete transcription and then types it into the focused application.

## Configuration

The user config is `~/.config/voxd/config.yaml`. Important defaults:

```yaml
gemma_server_url: http://localhost:9292
gemma_model: gemma-e4b
gemma_segment_seconds: 25
gemma_segment_overlap_seconds: 1
gemma_timeout: 300
record_chunk_seconds: 300
typing_delay: 1
typing_start_delay: 0.15
```

`record_chunk_seconds` controls on-disk chunk rotation, not maximum speech length.
The E4B service should stay warm for low latency; VOXD does not own or restart it.

Useful commands:

```bash
voxd --diagnose
voxd --autostart true
voxd --autostart false
voxd --version
```

If typing fails, verify `ydotool` and its socket:

```bash
systemctl --user status ydotoold.service
voxd --diagnose
```
